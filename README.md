INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT
	Diabetes is a disease that is prevalent very prominently in today's world. It is a condition that occurs when an individual's blood sugar level is higher than normal. Insulin, which is a hormone secreted in the pancreas, helps in regulating blood glucose levels. Diabetes has no cure, which is why it is important to take care of being diagnosed with diabetes. Millions of people are admitted to hospitals in the early stages of diagnosis and when the effects become worse. Getting admitted once should guide the patient towards a steady recovery of health. If the patient is required to get readmitted into a hospital, it can question the hospital's capability to help people recover from diseases. This research is carried out with a motive to determine the trend in which diabetes affects, which group of people is affected, and what are the reasons if any for readmission and assess the right type of diabetes medications. The progress so far is the collection of the data set, data cleaning, identifying the different attributes of the dataset, shortlisting Machine Learning algorithms that could be implemented in the further stages of the research, and the literature review of the related works.
